** constant v/s macros
 Macros are handled by the pre-processor - the pre-processor does text replacement in your source file, 
 replacing all occurances of 'A' with the literal 8.
 Constants are handled by the compiler. They have the added benefit of type safety.
 For the actual compiled code, with any modern compiler, there should be zero performance difference between the two.

** Segmentation fault :
 + A segmentation fault occurs when a program attempts to access a memory location that it is not allowed to access, 
 or attempts to access a memory location in a way that is not allowed (for example, attempting to write to a 
 read-only location, or to overwrite part of the operating system.
 
 + Segfaults are almost always due to trying to read or write a non-existent array element, 
 not properly defining a pointer before using it, or (in C programs) accidentally using a variable's value as an address.

** Delete Empty lines:
  awk 'NF' file
 + NF stands for "number of fields", those lines being empty have 0 fiedls, so that awk evaluates 0 to False and 
  no line is printed; however, if there is at least one field, the evaluation is True and makes awk perform 
  its default action: print the current line.

When a variable gets declared, memory to hold a variable of that type is allocated at an unused memory location.
The type, int, tells the compiler how much memory to store starting at that address.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A C compiler converts C source code to assembly source code. 
variable names are converted to relative memory addresses
To a compiler all variables are just memory addresses and sizes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable.

The C language is call-by-value. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dereferencing is just indirection. 
It is telling the compiler, â€œI have the address of a variable in the pointer. 
I want to access that pointed-to address either to get a value or set a value".
Dereference means to indirectly access the address stored in the pointer. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
int ival = 1;
int *iptr = &ival;
(OR)
int ival ,*iptr;
iptr = &ival;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
int myarray[4] = {1,2,3,0};
int *ptr = myarray;
When an array is created, the array variable cannot be reassigned.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A pointer to a struct holds the memory address of the first element in the struct
	struct person first;
	struct person *ptr;
 
	first.age = 21;
	first.name = "full name";
	ptr = &first;
