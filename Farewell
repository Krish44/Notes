Dear all,

Journey has come to a point where I have to take a pause and switch the compartment. 

Four years back, when I arrived at Chennai, everything seemed so different. People-language-places, sometimes felt like too much to take at a time. All thanks to my colleagues and friends who stood beside andmade things managable.
We need a second sight to fall in love with this city. It's the people in here who make it beautiful. Not just the places. 

Got opportunities to work in two wonderful accounts like 
"Walmart" and "Express Scripts" and work experience I gained from here is going to help me throughout. 
Personally, being cognizant is an emotional attachment. I would like to thank all my colleagues for making a friendlier work atmosphere around and creating a comfort zone, a much need one.

I would like to convey my heartily gratitude to all my managers, supervisors who guided and nurtured me and made sure that my progress is inline with the goals set.

Change is hard at the beginning, change is the only constant.
All those great memories I had with you people will stay. I will cherish it forever.
Hope our paths will cross again someday.


Cheers,
Krishna Prasad
