# Save the deleted files to a log file:
	find /home/a -mtime +5 -exec ls -l {} \; > mylogfile.log

# Removing files older than 7 days:
	find /path/to/ -type f -mtime +7 -name '*.gz' -execdir rm -- '{}' \;
	* More efficient
		find /path/to/ -type f -mtime +7 -name '*.gz' -print0 | xargs -r0 rm --  
	* Much faster (rm only once for all)
		find /path/to/ -type f -mtime +7 -name '*.gz' -execdir rm -- '{}' +
	* Equivalent to above but using delete
		find /path/to/ -type f -mtime +7 -name '*.gz' -delete
